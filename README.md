# proof-that-i-am-wedtm

This repo is a hope that I can get GitHub staff to disable the 2FA on my account so I can log back in.

In early 2019, I lost my Yubikey with my master GPG key, and subkeys used for SSH auth.

I was smart, and backed up the keys to offline storage, so I was able to re-establish them on a new yubikey. However, proving identity is apparently not able to be done via GPG validation.


### It's my hope that this repo can prove cryptographically that I really am wedtm.
